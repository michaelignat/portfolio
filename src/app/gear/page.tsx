          My go-to for both on-the-go work and at-home productivity. It handles
          all of my coding needs with ease. The compact form factor makes it
          perfect for travel, while still providing enough screen real estate
          for comfortable daily use.

          Got rid of my three 24" monitors and got this. 240HZ, OLED, 0.03ms
          response, must anything else be said.

          Can definitely find cheaper chairs that are the same or better
          quality, but I've had this for years and it's still going strong.
          Premium build quality and durability make it a worthwhile investment

          Recently switched from VS Code. The built-in AI helps me write code
          faster, explain complex functions, and even refactor entire

          better than GitHub Copilot so far.

        <Tool title="Ubuntu (WSL)">
          I should probably just switch to Linux permanently, but using Ubuntu
          via WSL in Windows Terminal has been doing me fine - pairing it with
          fish shell autocomplete and aliases speeds up my workflow
          significantly.

          Not exactly a tool, but thought I'd mention that I'm using Biome as my

        The powerful design capabilities for when I'm wireframing ideas or

        and detailed designs. The ability to create reusable components and

          Mostly used when consulting and charging billable hours (or to see how
